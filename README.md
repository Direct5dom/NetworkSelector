Because Microsoft does not provide the function of saving network settings as default in Windows, it is very troublesome for users who need to frequently switch gateway servers or proxy servers, so I developed this small tool.

## ‚¨áDownload

### Get it from the Microsoft Store (recommended)

</a>

### Get a self-signed version from Releases (not recommended)

You can go directly to [Releases ¬∑ Direct5dom/NetworkSelector](https://github.com/Direct5dom/NetworkSelector/releases) to download the installation package I have packaged.

> It should be noted that because this project uses self-signed sideloading, you need to turn on the developer mode of Windows, right-click and "Use PowrShell" to run Install.ps1 instead of double-clicking WinWoL.msix directly.

> The self-signed version requires turning on developer mode and installing a certificate, which is not a secure way to install an app.
